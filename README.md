Python Challenge
This repo has the PyBank and PyPoll challenges for me to practice.
There are two folders w/the following files: 
PyBank: 
	analysis: output data
	Resources: input data
	main.py: python code
PyPoll: 
	analysis: output data
	Resources: input data
	main.py: python code

Hope this message finds you well.
